# AWS Subnet Terraform Module

This Terraform module provisions an AWS Subnet with optional sharing functionality using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM). The module includes customizable tag options and allows you to conditionally share the created subnet with other AWS accounts or organizations.

## Features

- Creates an AWS Subnet with customizable tags.
- Optionally shares the subnet with other AWS accounts or organizations using AWS RAM.
- Allows external principals to access the shared subnet (if enabled).
- Flexible resource naming conventions using the environment, application name, and other variables.

## Resources

This module creates the following resources:
- `aws_subnet`: The subnet created in the specified VPC.
- `aws_ram_resource_share`: (Optional) A RAM resource share for sharing the subnet.
- `aws_ram_resource_association`: (Optional) Associates the created subnet with the resource share.
- `aws_ram_principal_association`: (Optional) Associates an AWS Account or Organization with the resource share.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use this module in your Terraform code:

```hcl
module "subnet" {
  source = "github.com/test.git//aws/networking/subnet-shared"

  vpc_id                   = "vpc-xxxxxx"
  subnet_cidrs             = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zones       = "us-east-1a"
  map_public_ip_on_launch  = true
  sub_type                 = "public"

  # Optional parameters for sharing the subnet
  share_subnet             = true
  allow_external_principals = false
  principal_id             = "123456789012"  # AWS Account ID or Organization ARN

  # Tagging
  auid                     = "SE-1234"
  zone                     = "us-east-1a"
  region                   = "us-east-1"
  environment              = "prod"
  application_name         = "app-name"
  department               = "IT"
  business_owner_email     = "owner@example.com"
  dev_owner_email          = "dev@example.com"
  criticality              = "high"
  cost_center              = "CC-12345"
  maintenance_window       = "Sun:02:00-Sun:04:00"
  source_tool              = "terraform"
  additional_tags          = {
    CustomTag = "custom-value"
  }
}
```
